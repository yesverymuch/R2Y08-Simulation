#calculate Rx, Ry, and Rz using a normal regular physical calculator since it is easier than encoding the formula here

#x, y, and z indicate position of chosen point
#T is time
#a is fresh air ventilation rate and w is deposition rate
#V is volume of room and A is area of room surfaces that will be deposited on
#D is effective indoor diffusion coefficent
#Rx, Ry, and Rz are in the paper and depend on the dimensions of the room

#sorry it took a long time to make this. it was hard to understand the formula at first, especially the R variables
